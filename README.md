## Goals:
- Take a screenshot
- Output an image file
- View the image file with your system's default image viewer
- Show a simple GUI that displays the image maybe

## How:
Java using Robot and Swing

## Known bugs:
Sometimes, on Windows, the program will detect multiple screens but will only insist on taking a screenshot of one of them regardless of screen choice.
